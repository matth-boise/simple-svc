it looks like when service-a calls service-b's Service ip (no port - i.e., :80)
  the called url is not modified with the Service containerPort (:9000) thus service-b's envoy matches the call to filter listener for service-b-eastwest.

read documentation...
- the ingress listener has use_original_dst, though that may be deprecated?  regardless, should be able to set listeners up 
  to differentiate only local networking (outbound eastwest) and networking from the outside (whether using original_dst port - or other)
